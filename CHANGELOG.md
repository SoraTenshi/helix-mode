# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (2025-03-15)

New features:

- Replacements, accessed via `r` or `R`.
- More insert-mode state switchers (`a`, `A`, `I`).
- Colon commands (currently only `:w` and `:write` supported).

## 0.2.0 (2025-03-10)

Added a custom searching mode that replaces the previous usage of
`isearch`. Use `/` to initiate the search and `n`/`N` to navigate
matches.

Added `O` (newline insert above) and fixed a couple bugs.

## 0.1.0 (2025-03-09)

Initial release! Only supporting a minimal subset of my most-used
Helix keybindings. Mostly the basics.
